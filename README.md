# networks
This repo contains some simple code that works with sockets and computer networking.

SMTPClient.py --> This is a python script which automates taking advantage of UVA's open relay email server.

server and client.py --> These are just simple python sockets.

I have also coded a DNS Modifier, which intercepts recursive DNS requests and modifies any search for Virginia Tech's homepage and redirects the user to UVA's homepage. The reliable data protocol that allows TCP to have reliable data transfers over an unreliable network, this involved an unreliable network simulator, ACKs, checksumming, and timeout intervals. Lastly, I have also coded the Distance-Vector algorithm that allows routers to share their neighbors information and calculate the shortest path via DP. However I cannot add these to the public repo as they are all assignments for my networks class.
